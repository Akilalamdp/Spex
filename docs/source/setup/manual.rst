Setting up Spex manually
========================

.. note::
    In doubt as to which method to use when setting up Spex? See :ref:`sec-setup`.


.. warning::
    Manually setting up Spex means *you* are responsible for installing the
    C libraries and Python packages that Spex needs, and that the version of
    Python used is recent enough.

    This page is a place-holder -- if you choose this option, you should know
    what to do. If you don't, use the Nix or Docker methods.
